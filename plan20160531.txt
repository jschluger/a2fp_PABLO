Crucial Jobs:
- getting processing to load (no graphics = rip)

Core functionality:
- bloons should move along paths, which the user can choose at the begining of the game
- turrets should target bloons in their proximity and then kill through prioriy
- user should be able to buy turrets and place them on valid locations on the map
- hp
- money

Extras:
- stronger bloons
- better turrets (upgrades)
- user can change what priority of enemies to be killed is based on
- other maps

Priority/Prerequisite Order:
Bloon movement -> Turret Placement -> Turret Attacks -> Map -> Extras

Tasks that can be delegated:
- turret/bloon variety (Part of Extras)
- hp
- money

Collaborative Stuff:
- how priority queue actually works (agreement)

Timeline:
We have a tight schedule and course changes don't seem so friendly at the moment. However, we think the three of us can crank up a working version by the beginning of next week and we aim to work as diligently as possible to achieve all our goals. We have little room for setbacks and course changes, but we have a set plan to implement this project. We haven't figured who will be in charge of what task but we do know the steps to take from here (as shown by the Prereq Order).
