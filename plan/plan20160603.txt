Crucial Jobs:
- placing turrets
- projectiles

Core functionality:
- bloons should move along paths, which the user can choose at the begining of the game
- turrets should target bloons in their proximity and then kill through prioriy
- user should be able to buy turrets and place them on valid locations on the map
- hp
- money

Extras:
- stronger bloons
- better turrets (upgrades)
- user can change what priority of enemies to be killed is based on
- other maps

Priority/Prerequisite Order:
Bloon movement -> Turret Placement -> Turret Attacks -> Map -> Extras

Tasks that can be delegated:
- turret/bloon variety (Part of Extras)
- hp
- money

Collaborative Stuff:
- how priority queue actually works (agreement)

Timeline:
1. Find a plausible way to place turrets (whether through recreation of the map or other means)
2. Make projectiles
3. Finish up ArrayPriorityQueue
4. Hp and Money System
5. Expand on Turrets!!!
