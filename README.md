Use the towers (monkey, boomerang, cannon, and supermonkey) to defeat the bloons in your path. Beware, once you allow too many bloons to pass through, our health will deplete and the game will end! To prevent this, place your towers in strategic locations and be mindful of your money!

To speed up the process, use the speed up button to run the game at 120 fps (default: 60 fps)! You can place towers while the bloons are moving but it is recommended you do so between levels and then click the next level button to proceed! 

Good luck!
